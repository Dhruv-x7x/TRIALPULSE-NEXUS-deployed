# TrialPlus Nexus 10X - Final Project Report

## 🚀 Overview
TrialPlus Nexus 10X is an AI-powered Clinical Trial Intelligence Platform designed to unify siloed clinical data, provide real-time risk assessments, and automate operational workflows through an agentic AI architecture.

## 📊 Key Results & Features
- **Data Scale**: Successfully unifies data for 57,974 patients across 3,401 sites and 23 studies.
- **Deep Integration**: Consolidates 9 disparate data sources (EDC, Lab, SAE, Coding, etc.) into a single **Unified Patient Record (UPR)**.
- **DQI Core**: Implements an 8-component Data Quality Index (DQI) with real-time scoring.
- **Agentic AI**: A 6-agent orchestration system (Supervisor, Diagnostic, Forecaster, Resolver, Executor, Communicator) using ReAct loops for autonomous problem-solving.
- **Digital Twin**: A virtual replica of the trial for what-if simulations and 10,000-run Monte Carlo projections.
- **ML Intelligence**: Production-ready models for Patient Risk Classification, Issue Detection, and Resolution Prediction.
- **Pre-trained AI**: Includes a custom-trained Ollama adapter (`trialplus-nexus-v1`) for specialized clinical reasoning.

## 💻 Technology Stack
| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **LLM** | Groq (primary) + Ollama (fallback) | Agent reasoning, generation |

## 🛠️ Reproducibility
The `TrialPlusNexus` folder contains everything necessary to mirror the current development environment:
- **Full Database State**: A complete PostgreSQL dump (`database/nexus_complete_backup.sql`) capturing every row, column, and feature.
- **Complete Source Code**: Backend (FastAPI), Frontend (React/Vite), and core logic.
- **Utility Scripts**: All 150+ specialized scripts for data sync, model training, and verification.

## 📐 Architecture
- **Layered Intelligence**: From the Data Foundation up to the 6 Role-Based Dashboards.
- **Knowledge Graph**: Neo4j integration for tracking issue dependencies and cascade effects.
- **Model Governance**: Automated drift detection and explainability via SHAP.
